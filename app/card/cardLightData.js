                Modern architecture prioritizes the functionality of spaces,
                often embracing minimalist designs. This approach emphasizes
                clean lines, open floor plans, and the use of materials like
                steel, glass, and concrete to create efficient and
                straightforward structures.

              <p class="pt-2 text-[#5a5a5a] dark:text-[#fff]">
                Sustainability is a cornerstone of modern architecture.
                Architects incorporate eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient
                systems, and green building techniques to reduce environmental
                impact. Innovations such as green roofs, solar panels, and
                passive heating and cooling systems are commonly integrated into
                modern designs.

                Advancements in technology have significantly influenced modern
                architecture. Digital design tools and software, such as
                Building Information Modeling (BIM), allow architects to create
                more precise and complex structures.
