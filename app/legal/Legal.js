  This Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy (“Policy”) applies to the makecomponents.com website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”) and outlines how this Website operator (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”) addresses copyright infringement notifications and how you (“you” or “your”) may submit a copyright infringement complaint.
  </div>
  
  <div className="pb-10 text-textcolor pt-6">
  Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we ask our users and their authorized agents to do the same. It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notifications of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) of 1998, the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website. This policy has been created with the help of the DMCA policy generator (https://www.websitepolicies.com/dmca-policy-generator).

  <h1 className="title-font text-secondary font-semibold text-2xl">  What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint</h1>

  <div className="pb-1 text-textcolor pt-6">
  
  Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, consider whether the use could be considered fair use. Fair use states that brief excerpts of copyrighted material may, under certain circumstances, be quoted verbatim for purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research, without the need for permission from or payment to the copyright holder. If you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a copyright complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user in question to see if you can resolve the matter directly with the user.
  </div>
  
  <div className="pb-1 text-textcolor pt-6">
  Please note that if you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.
  </div>

  <div className="pb-10 text-textcolor pt-6">
  We may, at our discretion or as required by law, share a copy of your notification or counter-notification with the account holder engaged in the allegedly infringing activity or for publication. If you are concerned about your information being forwarded, you may wish to hire an agent to report infringing material for you.
  </div>
  
 
 
  <h1 className="title-font text-secondary font-semibold text-2xl ">  Notifications of infringement</h1>
  
  <div className="pb-1 text-textcolor pt-6">
  Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. Our response may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material.
</div>
  
<div className="pb-1 text-textcolor pt-6">
  If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in response to a Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good faith effort to contact the affected user with information concerning the removal or restriction of access, which may include a full copy of your Notification (including your name, address, phone, and email address).

  </div>
  
  <div className="pb-10 text-textcolor pt-6">
  The process described in this Policy does not limit our ability to pursue any other remedies we may have to address suspected infringement.
  </div>

    <h1 className="title-font text-secondary font-semibold text-2xl"> Changes and amendments</h1>
  
    <div className="pb-1 text-textcolor pt-6">
  We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Website and Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We may also provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.
  </div>
  
  <div className="pb-1 text-textcolor pt-6">
  An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Website and Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes.
